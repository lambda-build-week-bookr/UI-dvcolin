# Bookr - User Interface (Colin de Vries)

## Languages Used ##

## HTML ##

I used semantic HTML to create the structure and content of the web pages, adding classes, ID's, and data attributes to structure my code and make it more meaningful.

## LESS / CSS ##

Using LESS, I created several variables and mixins, and was able to better organize my code by importing several LESS files into an index.less file. Using nesting, I was able to better structure my CSS and style elements with higher specificity. I stored the fonts and colors in variables, which made them easy to remember and reuse several times throughout the website. I created several mixins, for fonts, `display: flex` and sections with identical designs. I sized text using `rem`, allowing the text to be responsive if the user changes the font settings in the browser. In addition, I used variables for media queries, which I then used to change the styles of elements as the web page grows larger in width. I started my design mobile-first and incorporated all screen widths into a responsive design.

## JavaScript ##

Using JavaScript, I created reusable components on the "About" page. With event listeners and data attributes, I created buttons that filter group members based on their role in the project.


## Marketing Page ##

Marketing page was created based on UX designer's layout. I incorporated chosen colors and fonts into the project, including local fonts. The marketing page is responsive, and will look good on all screen widths. Starting mobile first, I added two media queries for a tablet and desktop layout.

## About Page ##

Created my own design based on the marketing page, describing all of our team members and their roles in the project. Incorporated JS components into tabs that filter team members based on their role.
