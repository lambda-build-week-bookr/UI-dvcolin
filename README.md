# Bookr - User Interface (Colin de Vries)

## Languages Used ##

## HTML ##

I used semantic HTML to create the structure and content of the web pages, adding classes, ID's, and data attributes to structure my code and make it more meaningful.

## LESS / CSS ##

Using LESS, I created several variables and mixins, and was able to better organize my code by importing several LESS files into an index.less file. Using nesting, I was able to better structure my CSS and style elements with higher specificity. I stored the fonts and colors in variables, which made them easy to remember and reuse several times throughout the website. I created several mixins, for fonts, `display: flex` and sections with identical designs. I sized text using `rem`, allowing the text to be responsive if the user changes the font settings in the browser. In addition, I used variables for media queries, which I then used to change the styles of elements as the web page grows larger in width. I started my design mobile-first and incorporated all screen widths into a responsive design.

## JavaScript ##

Using JavaScript, I created reusable components on the "About" page. With event listeners and data attributes, I created buttons that filter group members based on their role in the project.
